  # 0. Installation and requirements ⚙️
  - Pre requirements:
  1. Install Node.js
  2. Visual Studio Code
  3. Install Chrome Browser

  - Installation
  The steps to download and install the template and view it from Visual Studio Code are described below.

  1. Clone the repository code from GitHub.
  2. Import the project in Visual Studio Code.
  3. From the top toolbar, go to Terminal > New Terminal.
  4. From the terminal, run the command npm install

  # 1. Test execution 🚀

  You can run the tests using the following commands:

  - Run a single test file, Login Tests Cases:
    npx playwright test login.spec.ts chromium

  - Run a single test file, Task Tests Cases:
    npx playwright test task.spec.ts chromium

  - Run a single test file, API Tests Cases:
    npx playwright test --project="API Tests"

  - To access to the report of the test cases that were executed:
    npx playwright show-report
    
  # 2. General Structure 💾
 
  The project is structured as follows:
  - 📊 playwright-report : It is auto-generated by the framework.
  - 🔋 pageobjects: contain the page object files
  - ⛏️ tests: contain the test files
  - 📸 test-results: folder in which screenshots are saved (when a test fails)
  - 🛠 utils: folder containing enums that are used by the different tests
  - 🫀 playwright.config.ts: main configuration file containing all details for test excecutions
 
  # 3. Playwright Config 🧠
 
  This file contains all the configuration needed to run the tests. In order to understand it better please refer to https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration. The main sections to be configured in this documents are:
 
  - baseUrl: this is the url used to open the browser, ⚠️this value may be change but it must be returned to its default value before pushing code⚠️
  - Reporters: contains how you can make the build the report and you can select the type
  - Projects: contains configuration for each desired project (different browsers, devices and also API)
 
  # 4. Tests 💬
 
  This is the place from which we call our Page Objects and their methods to simulate the different user actions.
 
  Each step test file corresponds to only one functionality.
 
  DOs / DON'Ts
 
  - ✅ Import information such as: user, tasks, etc (if it's not passed as a parameter)
  - ✅ Import other pages only for navigation purposes
 
  - ❌ Duplicate tests that do basically the same, try to parametrize them instead.
 
  # 5. Page Objects 🖥
 
  Page Object files are JavaScript classes that represent a page in our application (example: Home Page, Login Page and Task Page). Each Page Object class has a certain amount of elements (which represent the different elements on a page) and methods (which represent user actons).
 
  Example: The element "name input" and the method "fillNameinput"
 
  SELECTORS: The elements are obtained using the selectors provided by Playwright or build with the traditional page.locator(condition).
 
  Example:
  - I want to locate the firstName input, that has an Id = "firstName" => page.locator('#firstName')
  - I want to locate using the Playwright locators mode with a data-test-id and by the role = page.getByTestId('app-sidebar-container').getByRole('button', { name: 'Añadir tarea' })
 
  DO / DON'T
 
  - ✅ Define page elements using strong selectors (preferably using Playwright locators)
  - ✅ Use CSS to locate page elements
  - ✅ Name the methods in a way that they result descriptive (feel free to add a comment when needed)
 
  - ❌ Use elements from other pageObject classes in a method
  - ❌ Use selectors that depend on hierarchy or texts values
  - ❌ Implement static waits (browser.pause())
  - ❌ Implement validation in Page Object methods
 
  # 6. Utils 🧰
 
  Utils folder contains files that are used to assert, transform, provide data to the tests. This is its content:
  
  - enums.js: contains enums commonly used in classes / steps
 
 Notes:
  - ✅ Define enums to use in switch cases (Instead of "case 'pet reward':" use "case rewards.nonRatedRewards.PET_RWD")
